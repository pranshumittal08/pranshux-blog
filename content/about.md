# About Me

Hi! My name is Pranshu Mittal, and I'm a computer vision engineer with a passion for first-principles learning. Over the years, I've developed skills across diverse domains - business accounting, video editing, 2D animation, graphic design, sales and marketing, coding, and equity research - not because I lack focus, but because circumstances and opportunities have demanded it.

This adaptive learning approach taught me something crucial: the power of understanding concepts from the ground up. For the past five years, I've channeled this first-principles mindset into what excites me most - artificial intelligence and machine learning. What started as curiosity-driven exploration has evolved into my profession as a computer vision engineer, but more importantly, it's shaped how I approach learning itself.

On this blog, I share in-depth tutorials that break down complex AI, ML, and computer vision concepts using first-principles thinking. Rather than just explaining what algorithms do, I explore why they work, how they evolved, and how you can build intuition around them from scratch. My goal is to make these powerful technologies accessible by deconstructing them into their fundamental components.

Each post reflects my belief that true understanding comes not from memorizing formulas or copying code, but from building concepts step by step until the complex becomes intuitive. Welcome to my journey of learning, teaching, and exploring the fascinating world of artificial intelligence.
