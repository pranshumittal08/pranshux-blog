Hi! My name is Pranshu Mittal, and I'm a computer vision engineer with a passion for first-principles learning. Over the years, I've developed skills across diverse domains such as business accounting, video editing, 2D animation, graphic design, sales and marketing, coding, and equity research - not because I lack focus, but because circumstances and opportunities have demanded it.

Rather than viewing this as scattered learning, I've come to see it as one of my greatest blessings. Each domain I've explored has enriched my problem-solving toolkit in unexpected ways. The analytical thinking from equity research sharpens my approach to model evaluation, the storytelling skills from video editing and animation help me communicate complex technical concepts, and the customer-centric mindset from sales and marketing ensures I build solutions that actually solve real problems. This cross-pollination of skills has given me a unique advantage: I can bridge the gap between technical implementation and business impact, between abstract algorithms and practical applications.

This adaptive learning approach taught me something crucial: the power of understanding concepts from the ground up, and when you learn something this way, it stays with you for a very long time. More importantly, having a diverse skillset allows me to approach problems from multiple angles - whether I'm debugging a computer vision pipeline, explaining technical concepts to stakeholders, or designing user-friendly interfaces for ML applications. The pattern recognition skills I developed across different domains now help me spot connections and solutions that might not be obvious to someone with a more specialized background.

For the past five years, I've channeled this first-principles mindset into what excites me most - artificial intelligence and machine learning. What started as curiosity-driven exploration has evolved into my profession as a computer vision engineer, but more importantly, it's shaped how I approach learning itself.

On this blog, I share in-depth tutorials that break down complex concepts that interest me using first-principles thinking. Rather than just explaining what algorithms do, I explore why they work and how you can build intuition around them from scratch. My goal is to make powerful technologies accessible by deconstructing them into their fundamental components.

Each post reflects my belief that true understanding comes not from memorizing formulas or copying code, but from building concepts step by step until the complex becomes intuitive. My multidisciplinary background means I can explain technical concepts through various lenses - whether that's using visual design principles to illustrate neural network architectures or applying business logic to explain why certain ML approaches succeed in the real world. Welcome to my journey of learning, teaching, and exploring the fascinating world of artificial intelligence.
