### **What is a Histogram?**

An image histogram is a graphical representation showing the distribution of pixel intensities in an image. For a grayscale image with intensity values ranging from 0 to 255, the histogram plots:

- X-axis: Intensity values (0-255)
- Y-axis: Number of pixels at each intensity level

The histogram reveals important characteristics about an image:

- Dark images have histograms concentrated toward the left (low intensities)
- Bright images have histograms concentrated toward the right (high intensities)
- Low-contrast images have histograms concentrated in a narrow range
- High-contrast images have histograms spread across the full range

#### **The Problem Histogram Equalization solves**

Many images suffer from poor contrast due to:

- Inadequate lighting conditions during capture
- Camera limitations
- Environmental factors (fog, haze, backlighting)

These result in images where pixel intensities cluster in a narrow range, making details hard to distinguish. **Histogram equalization** addresses this by transforming the intensity distribution to utilize the full available range more effectively.

The goal with histogram equalization is to find a transformation function T(r) that maps input intensities r to output intensities s, such that the output histogram is approximately *uniform (flat)*.
### **Global Histogram Equalization**

This technique is applied to the entire image uniformly irrespective of the difference in light intensities at different locations.  
##### **Advantages:**

- Simple to implement
- Effective for images with uniform lighting
##### **Disadvantages:**

- Not suitable for images with varying local characteristics
- May wash out details in bright or dark areas
- Can cause over enhancement in some regions
##### **Choose Global HE when:**

- Speed is critical
- Simple, uniform scenes
- Limited computational resources
- Preprocessing for further analysis


### **Local Histogram Equalization**

Applies histogram equalization to small neighborhoods around each pixel. It tackles the limitation of GHE i.e. being unable to adapt to local contrast and preserves local details.
##### **Process**:

1. Define a window size (e.g., 5√ó5, 7√ó7)
2. For each pixel, create a window around that pixel
3. Calculate histogram and CDF for that neighborhood
4. Transform the center pixel using the local CDF
5. Move to the next pixel

**Handle Boundaries:** Use padding or truncated windows at image edges

**Window size controls adaptation**:

- Smaller windows = more local adaptation, more artifacts
- Larger windows = less local adaptation, smoother results
##### **Advantages**:

- Preserves local details better
- Adapts to local image characteristics
- Better handling of varying illumination
##### **Disadvantages**:

- Computationally expensive
- Can introduce artifacts at region boundaries
- May amplify noise

### **Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE)**

Similar to local histogram equalization but with refinements to handle computational complexity and artifacts.

##### **Key improvements**:

- Efficient computation using interpolation
- Better boundary handling
- Noise reduction mechanisms
##### **Key Process**

1. Divide image into non-overlapping tiles (e.g., 8√ó8 grid of rectangular regions)
2. Calculate histogram and transformation function for each tile center
3. For each pixel:
    - Identify the 4 nearest tile centers
    - Use **bilinear interpolation** to blend the 4 transformation functions
    - Apply the interpolated transformation to the pixel

#####  **Mathematical Formula**

For pixel at position (x,y), find 4 nearest tile centers with transformations T‚ÇÅ, T‚ÇÇ, T‚ÇÉ, T‚ÇÑ:

```
T_interpolated(x,y) = w‚ÇÅ√óT‚ÇÅ + w‚ÇÇ√óT‚ÇÇ + w‚ÇÉ√óT‚ÇÉ + w‚ÇÑ√óT‚ÇÑ
```

Where weights w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, w‚ÇÉ, w‚ÇÑ are based on distance to each tile center.

##### **Key Advantages Over Local HE**

- **Computational efficiency**: Only calculate histograms for tile centers, not every pixel
- **Smoother results**: Interpolation reduces boundary artifacts
- **Configurable adaptation**: Tile size controls local vs global behavior

##### **Core Difference from Local HE**

- **Local HE**: Each pixel uses its immediate neighborhood
- **AHE**: Each pixel uses interpolated transformations from nearby tile centers

##### **Limitations:**
- **Noise amplification** - Enhances noise along with actual image features since there is no built-in mechanism to distinguish noise from signal. Particularly problematic in smooth regions (like sky and uniform backgrounds)
- **Over enhancement** - May result in harsh, unnatural appearance as it can create unnaturally high contrast in some regions.
- **Tile Size Dependency** - Small tiles may cause more noise amplification, potential blocking artifacts and large tiles may cause less local adaptation. There is no automatic method to determine optimal tile size.

The interpolation makes AHE much faster while maintaining most of the local adaptation benefits.

##### **Choose Local/AHE when:**

- Complex lighting conditions
- Computational resources available
- Research/analysis applications
- Maximum detail extraction needed

### **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)**

CLAHE was developed to address the main limitations of AHE - over-amplification of noise and artifacts, and over enhancement. 

##### **Process**:

1. Divide image into non-overlapping contextual regions (tiles)
2. Calculate histogram for each tile
3. **Clip the histogram**: Limit the height of histogram bins to a threshold
4. Redistribute clipped pixels uniformly across all bins
5. Apply histogram equalization to each tile
6. Use bilinear interpolation to eliminate boundary artifacts

##### Example of Histogram Clipping

**Step 1: Clip the Histogram**

Set clip limit = 300. Any bin exceeding this gets "clipped":

```
After clipping:
Intensity:  50   100   150   200   250
Count:      10   300   300    50    40
                  ‚Üì     ‚Üì
            Clipped  Clipped

Excess pixels: 200 + 500 = 700 pixels total
              (500-300) + (800-300)
```

**Step 2: Redistribute Excess Pixels**

The 700 "clipped" pixels get **evenly distributed** across **all** histogram bins:

```
Redistribution per bin = 700 √∑ 5 bins = 140 pixels per bin

Final histogram:
Intensity:  50   100   150   200   250
Count:     150   440   440   190   180
           ‚Üë     ‚Üë     ‚Üë     ‚Üë     ‚Üë
          +140  +140  +140  +140  +140
```

##### **Why This Works**

- **Prevents over-enhancement**: No single intensity gets boosted too much
- **Preserves total pixel count**: All original pixels are still accounted for
- **Creates more balanced distribution**: Extreme peaks are flattened and spread out

##### **Parameters**:

- Tile size: Smaller tiles provide more local adaptation
- Clip limit: Controls the amount of contrast enhancement

##### **Advantages**:

- Prevents over-enhancement
- Reduces noise amplification
- Excellent for medical and scientific images
- Preserves local details while improving global contrast

##### **Choose CLAHE when:**

- Image quality is paramount
- Medical/scientific applications
- Noisy images
- Professional results needed

### **Bi-Histogram Equalization (BBHE)**

This technique preserves the mean brightness of the image better than global histogram equalization.

##### **Process**:

1. Calculate the mean intensity of the image
2. Divide histogram into two parts at the mean
3. Apply histogram equalization separately to each part
4. Combine the results

##### **Variants**:

- **DSIHE** (Dualistic Sub-Image Histogram Equalization): Uses median instead of mean
- **MMBEBHE** (Minimum Mean Brightness Error Bi-Histogram Equalization): Optimizes the separation point

### **Weighted Histogram Equalization**

Assigns different weights to different intensity ranges based on their importance or desired enhancement level.

### **Color Image Histogram Equalization**

For color images, several approaches exist:

**RGB Channel-wise**: Apply histogram equalization to each R, G, B channel independently

- Simple but can cause color shifts

**HSV/HSI Space**: Convert to HSV, apply equalization only to the V (value/intensity) channel

- Preserves color information better

**YUV/Lab Space**: Apply equalization to the luminance channel only

- Industry standard for maintaining color fidelity
